CIS 497 DMD Senior Project
Code Version 7

Accomplishments:
	Programming:
	1) Added weighting for high resolution particles and oblong particles then removed it when there was little difference
	2) Added oblong particles - low res particles with smaller particles all as one unit

	Research:
	1) N/A

	Miscellaneous:
	N/A

Issues Encountered:
	Programming:
	1)Weighting for particle size failed-it did not make a difference. However I did not heavily weight oblong particles as a whole I weighted each individual particle, which may have been a poor decision except that literally nothing changed so it is probably fine.

	Research:
	1) N/A
	
Goals for Version 7:
	Programming:
	1) I would like to fix the underlying granular material math.
	2) I would like to start compiling all of the mathematic equations and my algorithm into an appendix in LaTex.
