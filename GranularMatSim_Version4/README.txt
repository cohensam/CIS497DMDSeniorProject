Samantha Cohen
CIS 497 DMD Senior Project
Code Version 4

Accomplishments:
	Programming:
	1) Got the basic solver loop working using viscosity, friction and cohesion, and gravity, with artificial pressure calculated with constraints as in my original SPH base code

	Research:
	N/A

	Miscellaneous:
	N/A

Issues Encountered:
	Programming:
	1)Despite getting the simulation to look generally correct, I did not include a bunch of the mathematics that the solver loops required, and I am a little concerned that this is a problem

	Research:
	N/A
	
Goals for Version 4:
	Programming:
	1) I would like to do a little further testing with all of the mathematics that I ended up not including
	2) I would like to start working on the high resolution particle calculations
